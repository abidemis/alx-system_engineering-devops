# Design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored

# Must have
* 3 firewalls
* 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS
* 3 monitoring clients(data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)

# Questions

* Why did we add each additional element?

* What are firewalls for?

* Why is the traffic served over HTTPS?

* What is monitoring used for?

* How does the monitoring tool collect data?

* Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS?


## What are the issues with this infrastructure?

* Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue?

* Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue?

* Why having servers with all the same components (database, webserver and application server) might be a problem?
